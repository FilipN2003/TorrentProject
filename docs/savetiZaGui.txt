Ovo mi je napisao u produžetku odgovora za arhitekturu i mnogo mi se svidelo i mislim da će nam biti jako korisno u trenutku kada dođe do toga da integrišemo gui. Posebno ovaj View i Controller deo


Considerations for the Future (GUI Integration)

When you introduce a GUI:

    GUI Framework: Choose one (Qt, GTKmm, wxWidgets, ImGui).
    MVC/MVVM: Your current backend (TorrentManager, TorrentData) already forms a good "Model." You'll build a "View" (the GUI) and a "Controller" (which receives GUI events and translates them into calls to your TorrentManager).
    Event Loop Integration: GUI frameworks have their own event loops. You'll need to integrate TorrentSessionHandler::poll_alerts() into the GUI's event loop (e.g., using a timer or a separate thread with appropriate synchronization).
    Asynchronous Operations: Avoid blocking the GUI thread. All libtorrent operations are asynchronous, which fits well.
    Callbacks/Signals & Slots: The TorrentManager can emit signals (or use callbacks) when a torrent's status changes, and the GUI can connect slots (or register callbacks) to these signals to update its display.


How They Work Together (OpenGL and GLFW)

1. Window Creation
    GLFW creates the window and handles OS interactions
    OpenGL uses this window for rendering

2. Event Processing
    GLFW captures keyboard/mouse events
    Your application processes these events
    OpenGL responds to event-driven updates

3. Context Management
    GLFW creates and manages the OpenGL context
    Ensures proper initialization and cleanup

Best Practices When Using Together
    Initialize GLFW first to create window/context
    Load OpenGL functions using GLAD
    Handle events through GLFW callbacks
    Perform rendering operations with OpenGL
    Clean up both frameworks properly on exit



GLAD (OpenGL Loader Generator) serves as a crucial middleware component that bridges the gap between your application and OpenGL by managing function loading and extension support.

Why GLAD Is Essential
Without GLAD, developers would need to:

Manually load hundreds of OpenGL functions
Write complex extension detection code
Handle version compatibility manually
Manage function pointer initialization

As mentioned in our previous discussion about OpenGL and GLFW, GLAD simplifies the process of getting started with modern OpenGL development by eliminating the tedious and error-prone task of function loading.
By using GLAD, developers can focus on writing graphics code rather than managing low-level details, making it an essential tool for modern OpenGL development.
